Plastique Theme - v1.0

To be able to build it, you'll need at least ruby 1.9.2, and middleman 3 installed

Run the bundle command to install all gems, then run middleman

The launch page is basically on http://localhost:4567/pages/dashboard/stats.html

=====

To build it, run middleman build in the command line

=====

A build is already included if you can't use middleman for some reason

=====
DOCUMENTATION
=====

The included build has an extra menu called documentation, in the primary navigation (open any page and check the dropdown for that menu)
